## Overview

This repository is a **benchmark and harness for measuring how well different LLMs perform real-world software-engineering tasks** when driven by a coding agent. The coding agent is [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's command-line coding agent, which by default talks only to Anthropic's own models. Here it is wired up to run with a model hosted in any of **three different places**, so you can put many models through the *same* tasks with the *same* agent and compare them directly on both quality and cost.

Each task points the agent at a real GitHub repository and a real problem. The agent works the task **non-interactively** through the `/swe` skill, which lands four design artifacts on disk (`github-issue.md`, `lld.md`, `review.md`, `testing.md`). The harness records what the run cost -- token usage, latency, and the number of LLM turns -- and a separate [judge](benchmarks/docs/harness-reference.md#scoring-the-artifacts-the-judge) scores the artifacts for quality. Run the same task across models and the resulting `metrics.json` / `eval.json` files line up side by side.

## The three hosting paths

Whichever path you choose, the agent (Claude Code), the tasks, the `/swe` skill, and the scoring are identical -- only *where the model runs and how the request reaches it* changes.

| | Path 1 - Anthropic on Bedrock | Path 2 - open-weight on Bedrock (LiteLLM) | Path 3 - self-hosted on EC2 (vLLM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Which models** | Anthropic family (Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) | Any open-weight model on Bedrock (Kimi, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral, GLM, …) | Any open-weight model you can serve (Qwen3-Coder, GLM, Kimi, …) |
| **Where the model runs** | Amazon Bedrock | Amazon Bedrock | Your EC2 GPU instance |
| **How Claude Code reaches it** | Directly, native Anthropic route | Through a [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) proxy we run that translates Anthropic ↔ OpenAI | Directly to your vLLM server (over an SSH tunnel) |
| **Cost model** | Pay-per-token | Pay-per-token | Fixed hourly GPU cost |
| **Extra infrastructure** | None | The LiteLLM proxy ([one script](benchmarks/scripts/bedrock-mantle-proxy.sh)) | An EC2 GPU node running vLLM |
| **Best for** | Benchmarking the Anthropic family | Model variety with zero infrastructure to manage | Data sovereignty, air-gapped, and high-volume workloads where fixed GPU cost beats per-token pricing |
| **Operational guide** | [Path 1](benchmarks/docs/path-anthropic-on-bedrock.md) | [Path 2](benchmarks/docs/path-open-weight-on-bedrock-litellm.md) | [Path 3](benchmarks/docs/path-self-hosted-vllm.md) |

The key enabler for Path 2 is the LiteLLM proxy. Claude Code speaks the [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-messages-api.html), which on Bedrock reaches **only** Claude/Anthropic models; the open-weight models are reachable solely through Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible [`bedrock-mantle` endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference.html) (Chat Completions). The proxy sits between the two and translates in both directions, so **any open-weight model on Bedrock can be wired into Claude Code** without changing the agent. All 38 third-party models on `bedrock-mantle` support tool calling and streaming natively.

## What a single benchmark run does

The flow below is identical across all three paths; only the box the request lands in (Bedrock's Anthropic route, the LiteLLM proxy, or your vLLM server) changes.

```mermaid

    participant G as GitHub repo
    participant CC as Claude Code<br/>(/swe skill)
    participant M as Model<br/>(path 1/2/3)
    participant J as Judge<br/>(codex_judge.py)

    H->>G: clone repo at pinned ref (temp dir)
    H->>CC: claude -p "/swe repo … problem … model …"
    loop agent loop (bounded by max_turns)
        CC->>M: Anthropic Messages request
        M-->>CC: reply (text and/or tool_use)
        CC->>CC: run tools (read repo, write artifacts)
    end
    CC-->>H: 4 artifacts + JSON result (tokens, latency, turns)
    H->>H: write metrics.json beside artifacts
    H->>G: remove temp clone
    J->>J: score the 4 artifacts against the rubric
    J-->>H: eval.json (quality scores) merged into metrics.json
```

The skill **stops at design**. It does not modify production code, run tests, or open PRs -- whether the design is any good is the downstream evaluation step the judge (or a human) performs on the artifacts. Full mechanics are in the [harness reference](benchmarks/docs/harness-reference.md).

> **"SWE" here means software engineering in general -- not [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/), the specific benchmark dataset.** The `/swe` skill lets you run any model against any task in any repo of your choosing. It is a *harness*, not a fixed benchmark set: compare results across models on the same task, or a single model across tasks of varying difficulty.

## Datasets

A dataset is a single YAML file: a metadata header plus a list of tasks, each pointing at a GitHub repo and a problem. Two datasets ship in [benchmarks/dataset/](benchmarks/dataset/):

- [hello-world.yaml](benchmarks/dataset/hello-world.yaml) -- a trivial sanity dataset (the [octocat/Hello-World](https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World) repo) for kicking the tires of a new model or endpoint.
- [mcp-gateway-registry.yaml](benchmarks/dataset/mcp-gateway-registry.yaml) -- the reference dataset, whose tasks are drawn from real upstream issues in [agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry).

**Nothing in the harness is specific to a particular repository.** Adding your own benchmark dataset is just writing another YAML file in the same format -- point tasks at any public repo and pinned ref. The dataset format is documented in the [harness reference](benchmarks/docs/harness-reference.md#the-dataset).

## Results: a worked example

To show what the harness produces, we ran it against [agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry) at tag `1.24.4` -- **5 tasks x 6 models = 30 artifact bundles**, each scored by the judge. The published numbers are below. (The `mcp-gateway-registry` dataset ships in [benchmarks/dataset/](benchmarks/dataset/mcp-gateway-registry.yaml) so you can reproduce the run; the generated artifacts themselves are not committed, so a customer's own runs never risk landing in version control. The only committed worked example under [benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/](benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/) is the trivial `Hello-World` sanity run.)

**Models benchmarked:** Claude Opus 4.8 (Path 1), Kimi K2 Thinking / K2.5, Mistral Devstral 2 123B, MiniMax M2.5, Qwen Coder Next (Path 2, Bedrock via the proxy), and Qwen 3.6 35B (Path 3, self-hosted vLLM on g6e.12xlarge).

### Scoring rubric (LLM-as-judge)

Each of the 4 artifacts is scored 0-100 by an independent judge session. Within each artifact the judge applies the same 4-criterion rubric, **25 points per criterion, summing to 100**:

| Criterion | 0-25 each | What the judge evaluates |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Completeness** | 25 | Did the artifact identify all affected files, dependencies, and components? Any obvious touchpoints (Terraform, IAM, Docker, tests, docs) missed? |
| **Correctness** | 25 | Are the proposed changes technically right? Would the design actually work? Are AWS service patterns idiomatic (e.g. ECS `secrets` block vs custom boto3 code)? |
| **Specificity** | 25 | Concrete file paths, line numbers, code snippets, resource names -- or vague hand-waving? Could a junior engineer implement this artifact alone? |
| **Risk awareness** | 25 | Rollback strategy, backwards-compat, deployment cutover, edge cases (cold start, secret rotation, token expiry, etc.) -- enumerated or ignored? |

**Artifact total = sum of 4 criteria (0-100). Task score = mean of the 4 artifact totals (also 0-100).** The judge is calibrated so a median artifact scores around 60-70, not 85; 90+ is reserved for genuinely excellent work; hallucinated files or functions lose at least 10 points off Correctness. Per-cell JSON with criterion breakdowns and judge notes lives at `{model}/{repo}/{task}/eval.json`. The judge itself is documented in the [harness reference](benchmarks/docs/harness-reference.md#scoring-the-artifacts-the-judge).

### Results -- 5 x 6 matrix

All cells are percentages (0-100%), averaged across the 4 artifacts per (task x model). Bold = top score in row.

|------|----------:|-------:|--------------:|-------------:|----------------:|---------------:|---------:|
| `remove-faiss` | **90.8%** | 87.8% ᵀ | 77.8% | 73.5% | 80.8% | 80.2% | 81.8% |
| `remove-efs-from-terraform-aws-ecs` | **90.8%** | 83.5% ᵀ | 83.8% | 76.0% | 80.2% | 75.2% | 81.6% |

¹ Kimi variant: ᵀ = K2 Thinking (tasks 1-3), ⁵ = K2.5 (tasks 4-5; substituted mid-benchmark after K2 Thinking's Bedrock backend started hanging requests).
² Qwen 3.6 35B ran self-hosted via vLLM on g6e.12xlarge (4x L40S), not through the Bedrock proxy.

### Per-model leaderboard

| Rank | Model | Avg score | # tasks |
|-----:|-------|----------:|--------:|
| 1 | Claude Opus 4.8 | **89.95%** | 5 |
| 2 | Kimi (combined K2 Thinking + K2.5) | **82.15%** | 5 |
| 3 | Qwen Coder Next | 79.80% | 5 |
| 4 | Mistral Devstral 2 123B | 75.95% | 5 |
| 5 | MiniMax M2.5 | 74.70% | 5 |
| 6 | Qwen 3.6 35B (self-hosted) | 69.70% | 5 |

### What the data says

- **Opus 4.8 wins every row** by 3-24 points. The per-cell delta to the second-place model is small relative to the 10-25x per-token cost ratio.
- **Kimi is a clear #2**, with a known dip on SSRF where K2 Thinking under-enumerated edge cases (66.2% vs Opus's 90.0%).
- **Mid/budget tier is not a clean ordering.** Qwen has the highest mid-tier average but only because of one outlier -- strip SSRF out and Qwen, Devstral, and MiniMax are within ~2 points of each other. Devstral wins `remove-efs`, MiniMax wins `keycloak-iam`.
- **SSRF was the genuine hardest task** (75.5% avg, 23.8-point spread), not the labelled "High" tasks. Security work rewards edge-case enumeration (private IPs, DNS rebinding, redirect handling) which the mid-tier under-delivered on.
- **Qwen 3.6 35B (self-hosted) is usable on bounded cleanup, drops on AWS-heavy tasks.** Scored 80.2% on FAISS removal and 75.2% on EFS removal but fell to 63.0% and 58.8% on the two High-difficulty AWS infrastructure tasks -- the smaller parameter count shows up when the design requires multi-service Terraform orchestration.
- **~20x cost spread translated to a ~21-point quality spread.** At the top of the field, the budget models are genuinely good enough for routine refactors and code-heavy work; frontier reasoning earns its premium on AWS-specific infrastructure design.

> **The example repo is the example, not the contract.** `/swe` works against any GitHub URL -- clone the target you actually care about, write the task description, and run.

## Prerequisites

- An **AWS account** with [Amazon Bedrock model access](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess) enabled for the models you want (Paths 1 and 2).
- **AWS credentials** configured locally (`aws configure`, an IAM role, or AWS SSO).
- **[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** installed.
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** and **Python 3.10+** for the harness.
- For Path 3: permission to launch an **EC2 GPU instance** (e.g. `g6e.12xlarge`).

> The `bedrock-mantle` endpoint used for Path 2 (third-party models) is currently available in **`us-east-1`**.

## Get started

1. **Set up the harness** (its own isolated virtual environment):

   ```bash
   cd benchmarks
   uv sync
   cp config/runner.example.yaml config/runner.yaml
   ```

2. **Pick a path and follow its guide** -- each ends with a copy-pasteable run command:
   - [Path 1 - Anthropic models directly on Amazon Bedrock](benchmarks/docs/path-anthropic-on-bedrock.md)
   - [Path 2 - open-weight models on Amazon Bedrock via a LiteLLM proxy](benchmarks/docs/path-open-weight-on-bedrock-litellm.md)
   - [Path 3 - self-hosted open-weight models on EC2 with vLLM](benchmarks/docs/path-self-hosted-vllm.md)

3. **Read the shared mechanics** once (they apply to every path): the [harness reference](benchmarks/docs/harness-reference.md) covers the dataset format, the runner config, running the benchmark, the metrics file, and the judge.

For Path 3 you must first stand up the vLLM server itself -- see [self-hosted/vllm/README.md](self-hosted/vllm/README.md).
